# Practicing Branches

After sharing this repository with you, you should create your own branch of the respository and call it yourname_branch. In that branch, create a python document and add a print statement of your own with an appropriate message of your choice. Commit your changes to the repository with a message.

After doing so, go and look at all the branches in the repository. Gain access to one of the branches and run someone's code. What message did they add?

Go back to your own branch. In your code, use the csv to create a class of your choice with at least 3 properties. Count how many customers are from china. Count how many customers work for an LLC. Commit your changes and submit on blackbaud the two numbers.

Pd: Aidan P. got that rizz in him.
